# Deployment Information

This section provides details about the deployment process for the Simple Storage smart contract, including deployment environments, contract verification, and relevant addresses.

## Contract Development and Deployment Overview

- **Development Environment**: The Simple Storage contract was developed using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), a powerful online tool for writing, testing, and deploying Solidity contracts.
  
- **L1 Testnet Deployment (Sepolia)**:
  - The contract was first deployed on the Sepolia testnet, an Ethereum Layer 1 test environment. This deployment allowed for initial testing and interaction with the contract in a controlled, decentralized environment.
  - **Contract Address on Sepolia**: [0xdC5F9AD68fad7239075f3D53763B99d4b5a55777](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xdC5F9AD68fad7239075f3D53763B99d4b5a55777)

- **L2 Testnet Deployment (zkSync Sepolia)**:
  - Following successful deployment on Sepolia, the contract was also deployed on zkSync Sepolia, a Layer 2 scaling solution that offers faster and more cost-effective transactions.
  - The deployment on zkSync Sepolia involved two scenarios: one where the contract was verified and another where it was not.

### Deployment Details for zkSync Sepolia

1. **Verified Contract**:
   - The contract was successfully deployed and verified on zkSync Sepolia.
   - **Contract Verification**: Before the contract could be deployed, it had to be signed. The terminal output confirming the verification can be seen here:

   - **Contract Address**: The verified contract is accessible on the zkSync Sepolia Explorer at the following address: [0x9CF546be37A97593B03Ae9C43623A8d62b81805B](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/address/0x9CF546be37A97593B03Ae9C43623A8d62b81805B)

2. **Unverified Contract**:
   - An attempt was also made to deploy a non-verified version of the contract on zkSync Sepolia.
   - **Contract Output**: The terminal output for the unverified deployment (where the code is not visible) is shown here:

   - **Contract Address**: The unverified contract can be viewed on the zkSync Sepolia Explorer at the following address: [0x9273E630574c77A2E530F1B467CE2b24936c554D](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/address/0x9273E630574c77A2E530F1B467CE2b24936c554D#transactions)

## Additional Notes

- **Plugin Stability**: It's important to note that the Remix zkSync plugin can be temperamental and may not always work as expected. If you encounter issues during deployment, itâ€™s recommended to try again later or ensure your setup aligns with the latest compatibility guidelines for zkSync.
